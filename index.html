                As a member of the executive board, I oversee all technology related matters. More specifically, I ensure that technology infrastructure and information systems are used efficiently towards achieving the university’s strategic objectives. Leading a team of five engineers deployed on two sites, our mission is:
                <ul>
                    <li>Administration, maintenance, upgrade and security of information systems.</li>
                    <li>Technical support services for students, staff and faculty.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>MundiaSIS:</b> Mundiapolis had to replace an aging desktop-based Student Information System with a web-based SIS in order to decentralize access to student records. After months of in-house development, we went live with MundiaSIS in Autumn 2013. <b>The student and faculty self-service allowed us to reduce the registrar's staff from three to one.</b></li>
                        <li><b>JIRA Service Desk:</b> Replacing a paper-based Student Services Office with Jira Service Desk <b>reduced the request processing time from 72h to less than 24h and increased student satisfaction significantly.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Digital marketing campaigns:</b> As part of a larger digital marketing team, the IT department is in charge of the design, development and maintenance of an optimized conversion process from landing pages to CRM. <b>In 2017 we doubled our conversion rate from 4 to 8 percent.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Call center setup:</b> With a growing number of leads coming from our digital campaigns, we created an internal call-center in charge of qualifying fresh leads. We developed a web-app that validates phone numbers and email addresses automatically, scores the leads before dispatching them over a team of operators according to some complex prioritization rules. <b>The tool reduced the lead processing time from 2 weeks to less than a day.</b></li>

                            <li><b>CROQS</b> as stated in the aforementioned Call center project, CROQS is a tool that helped a call center operators’ qualify their leads through an automatic validation of contact information, scoring and dispatching/scheduling of calls. <em>Technology used: Java Servlets, JQuery single page app, Google appengine.</em></li>

                <h4>July 2011 – March 2012 (9 months) | Casablanca</h4>
                As the sales representative for Infrastructure Technology Services (ITS) at IBM Morocco, I was in charge of identifying and closing business opportunities for infrastructure services across all industries.

                    <p>
                        This was probably the most intense professional experience of my career. In just 9 months I had to learn new sales skills, familiarize with new industries, navigate IBM’s complex internal procedures and above all, achieve a 6 Million USD target.
                        The most rewarding part was learning sales skills. I attended IBM’s Global Sales School in Austria, which is one of the best sales trainings in the world. <b>It helped me acquire the techniques necessary to conduct effective C-level sales meetings.</b>
                        I was able to sell technology services (Datacenter Maintenance, migrations, etc...) to Morocco’s largest companies such as Attijari, INWI, BMCE, Banque Populaire, and others. Disclaimer: I did not achieve the sales target.

                    <p>In September 2008 I teamed up with NGA’s former director in Casablanca to create the first HR SaaS solution for Morocco. In about 1 year, I single-handedly created a multitenant payroll and HR management solution in Java and Adobe Flex. We got our first customer by the beginning of 2010 and grown slowly to 5 customers by the end of the year. During that same period, we started raising VC money from Dayam Capital (Saham group). A few weeks before closing the deal, my co-founder quit, leaving the startup paralyzed. During a few months I tried to continue operations with zero capital, but had finally to shut down in summer 2011.</p>
